# D-D-Lunatic-Stats-Roll
Roll 1d20 and 1d6. The d20 determines the score, the d6 determines which stat you rolled for (1: STR, 2: DEX, 3: CON, 4: INT, 5: WIS, 6: CHA). If the d6 indicates a stat that has already been scored, take the average the the d20 roll and the existing score, rounded up. Repeat until all six stats are rolled.
